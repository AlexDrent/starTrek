    1) Cabbage/Goat/Wolf/Boat like intro-sequence with characters "beaming down"
    2) That acts as the start of the game
    3) Space invaders style client gameplay after intro, character can move left or right,
        either tackle OR shoot bad guys that gradually fall down from top of screen
        The game uses canvas, and you loose a life by missing a Gorn (they fall past the bottom
        of the canvas), you gain points by successfully "tackling" Gorn. Enemies fall in colomns.
        Kirk can only move into columns (in a jumpy way). Points increase by 1701 each time.
